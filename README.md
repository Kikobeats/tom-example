## Getting started

You need to install the project dependencies with `npm install`.

Then you are ready to run **tom** üê∂.

## Configuration

### Defining basic configuration

Your configuration project live at [tom.config.js](tom.config.js).

Under the hood we are using [`config`](http://npm.im/config) for differenciate between development and production credentials.

### Using Event System

Every time a command is executed, it emits an event.

You can use these events for connecting the service with your specific code.

Read [Event System](https://tom.js.org/#/?id=event-system) section at docs for knowing more.

## Launch

### from CLI

You can use `tom --help` or see [scripts](/scripts) to see it in action.

Execute  for started a HTTP server in your machine. The server has hot reloading.

## Production Ready

The service is almost production ready. You need to provide the [Environment Variables](https://tom.js.org/#/?id=environment-variables) for:

- [ ] **Stripe API Key** used by [`payment`](https://tom.js.org/#/?id=payment-1) commands
- [ ] **Email credentials** used by [`notification:email`](https://tom.js.org/#/?id=notificationemail) commands.

After that, just run your service with `npm start` üéâ.
